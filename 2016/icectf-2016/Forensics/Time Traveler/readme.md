# Time Traveler (Forensics - 45 Points,  1013 solves)

> I can assure you that the flag was on [this website](http://time-traveler.icec.tf/) at some point in time. 

Solution
--------

For this challenge we are going to use [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to find the flag.

When we query for the website we can see there was one snapshot saved on June 1st.

If we click on the snapshot we get the flag!
