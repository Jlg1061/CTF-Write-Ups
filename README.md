# Team Contagion CTF Writeups

Team members: to submit your writeup using a web browser:

1. [Create a branch for your changes](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
2. [Commit your changes to the branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/)
3. [Create a pull request to merge them into `master`](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
4. A team admin will approve your pull request

The same process can be done on a local clone of the repository. You will not be able to push to `master`, but you should be able to create a branch for your changes and push that.
